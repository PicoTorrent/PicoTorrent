PQL - The PicoTorrent Query Language
====================================

PicoTorrent ships with an embedded query language (called PQL) which makes it
possible to filter the torrent list view in order to quickly show relevant
information.

The query language is somewhat based on SQL but is designed to make querying
torrents easy. The building blocks of PQL are `Types`_, `Fields`_, `Units`_
and `Operators`_.


Types
-----
PQL supports two primitive and two compound types:

Primitive Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- :code:`NUMBER` - signed integer or floating-point number;
- :code:`STRING` - doublequoted series of Unicode characters.

Compound Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- :code:`SIZE` - consists of a :code:`NUMBER` type value followed by zero or
  one `size unit`_. See `type examples`_;
- :code:`SPEED` - consists of a :code:`NUMBER` type value followed by zero or
  one `speed unit`_. See `type examples`_.


Fields
------
These are the fields available to query:

- :code:`dl` (SPEED type) - the current downloading speed;
- :code:`name` (STRING type) - the name of the torrent as seen in the UI;
- :code:`progress` (NUMBER type) - the current progress in percents;
- :code:`size` (SIZE type) - the *total wanted* size - e.g. total size
  excluding skipped files;
- :code:`status` (STRING type) - the torrent current status.
  This field accepts the following string values:

  - :code:`downloading`;
  - :code:`error`;
  - :code:`paused`;
  - :code:`queued` - either for downloading or uploading;
  - :code:`seeding`;
  - :code:`uploading`;

- :code:`ul` (SPEED type) - the current uploading speed.


Units
-----
PQL use the JEDEC Standard 100B.01 prefixes for its units of `size`_ and `speed`_.
The units are used unquoted and are case insensitive. They can be separated
with an optional white space from the preceding numeric value.

.. _`size`:
.. _`size unit`:

Units of Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Used in conjunction with the `size` field and together form
:code:`SIZE` type.

- :code:`byte` - default unit of size if not other provided;
- :code:`kb` - Kilobytes;
- :code:`mb` - Megabytes;
- :code:`gb` - Gigabytes.

.. _`speed`:
.. _`speed unit`:

Units of Speed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Used in conjunction with `dl` and `ul` fields and together form
:code:`SPEED` type.

- :code:`bps` - bytes per second, default unit of speed if not other provided;
- :code:`kbps` - Kilobytes per second;
- :code:`mbps` - megabytes per second;
- :code:`gbps` - Gigabytes per second.


Operators
---------
PQL supports a handful of operators to make filtering flexible.

Logical Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two logical operators:

- :code:`and` - Logical And;
- :code:`or` - Logical Or.

Comparison Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In PQL you can use 6 comparison operators:

- :code:`<` - less than;
- :code:`<=` - less than or equal to;
- :code:`>` - greater than;
- :code:`>=` - greater than or equal to;
- :code:`=` - equal;
- :code:`~` - like. Case insensitive string matching.


Examples
--------

.. _`type examples`:

- Example of :code:`SIZE` type with :code:`NUMBER` value equal to *5*
  and *size unit* equal to *kb*.
  ::

    5kb

- Example of :code:`SPEED` type :code:`NUMBER` value equal to *10*
  and *speed unit* equal to *kbps*.
  ::

    10kpbs

- Torrents *larger than 1GB*.
  ::

    size > 1gb

- Torrents where the name contains *ubuntu*.
  ::

    name ~ "ubuntu"

- Torrents with either *1080p* or *720p* in the name.
  ::

    name ~ "1080p" or name ~ "720p"

- Torrents *downloaded at least to 90%*.
  ::

    progress >= 90

- Torrents *larger than 1GB* that are *currently downloading*.
  ::

    size > 1gb and status = "downloading"

- Torrents that are currently *queued*.
  ::

    status = "queued"

- Torrents that are *downloading* with *more than 10 mbps*.
  ::

    dl > 10mpbs

- Torrents that are *uploading* with *more than 5 mbps*.
  ::

    ul > 5mpbs
