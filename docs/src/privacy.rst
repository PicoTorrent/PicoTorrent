Privacy
=======

To support users with an increased need for privacy, we've made it easy to use
a proxy for BitTorrent traffic. You can also enable *anonymous mode* to further
obfuscate your identity.


Picking a VPN provider

There are many VPN providers, and you can even host your own somewhere.
However, for those looking for a quick and easy way of getting started, we've
compiled a small list of VPN providers we like.

Configuring a proxy is easy. Just open the *Preferences*, go to the *Connection*
tab and enter your details.
